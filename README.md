# Simple Pack Modeling Interface

Lithium-ion batteries have been ubiquitious for numerous energy applications. In particular, there is great interest in researching battery packs (i.e. simulating modules with multiple cells in series/parallel). Often, reduced-order models are preferred for pack-level investigation, so as to reduce computational overhead.

Along the aforementioned lines, the following repository seeks to accomplish several targets:
1) Detail an easy-to-use, robust API for simulating 'variable-size' battery packs 
2) Allow modelers to rapidly conduct cycling studies with variated operating conditions and parameters
3) Provide a post-processing and plotting interface to readily wrangle with large volumes of simulation results
4) Serve as a tool for research groups at large
    - _Developed primarily for INSERT OUR GROUP AND PAPER LINK HERE_ 
5) Serve as a well-documented tutorial/exercise for simulation development
    - _Existing libraries, though supportive of complex models, can be difficult to comprehend for beginner programmers and electrochemists alike. This codebase strives to be a simple introduction_

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** THIS CODEBASE IS VERY MUCH A WORK-IN-PROGRESS. ALTHOUGH FUNCTIONAL, THERE IS CERTAINLY ROOM FOR STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS 


## Configuring Simulations
`mainmodel.py` provides an example of a pack simulation setup
