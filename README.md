# Simple Pack Modeling Interface

Lithium-ion batteries have been ubiquitious for numerous energy applications. In particular, there is great interest in researching battery packs (i.e. simulating modules with multiple cells in series/parallel). Often, reduced-order models are preferred for pack-level investigation, so as to reduce computational overhead.

Along the aforementioned lines, the following repository seeks to accomplish several targets:
1) Detail an easy-to-use, robust API for simulating 'variable-size' battery packs 
2) Allow modelers to rapidly conduct cycling studies with variated operating conditions and parameters
3) Provide a post-processing and plotting interface to readily wrangle with large volumes of simulation results
4) Serve as a tool for research groups at large
    - _Developed primarily for INSERT OUR GROUP AND PAPER LINK HERE_ 
5) Serve as a well-documented tutorial/exercise for simulation development
    - _Existing libraries, though supportive of complex models, can be difficult to comprehend for beginner programmers and electrochemists alike. This codebase strives to be a simple introduction_

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** THIS CODEBASE IS VERY MUCH A WORK-IN-PROGRESS. ALTHOUGH FUNCTIONAL, THERE IS CERTAINLY ROOM FOR STRUCTURAL IMPROVEMENTS 


## Configuring Simulations

### Parameter Variation

_For further remarks on how parameters 'fit' into the model equations/DAE, see the `Electrochemical Model POV` section below_
 
Variations can be applied using a few different schemes. See the following examples with cathode porosity:

**Notations**  
$\epsilon_k$ = porosity of a given cell 'k'  
$v$ = porosity value  
$p$ = porosity percent  
$\sigma$ = porosity standard deviation

| **Code**                                                     | **Distribution Notation**                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `POS_ELEC_POROSITY = Variator.from_gaussian_percent("any name", v, p)` | $\epsilon_k \sim Uniform(v - \frac{p*v}{100}, v + \frac{p*v}{100})$ |
| `POS_ELEC_POROSITY = Variator.from_gaussian_percent("any name", v, p)` | $\epsilon_k \sim N(v, \frac{p*v}{100})$          |
| `POS_ELEC_POROSITY = Variator.from_gaussian_stddev("any name", v, \sigma)` | $\epsilon_k \sim N(v, \sigma)$                   |
