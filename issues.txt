1) They are accounting for separator... etc
    nope. 

2) Current/m2 differences.
    -> Q (1/A) = di/dt (1/A) is weighted in capacity calculation?
    -> nominal capacity == current function (because Crate=1 assumed)
    -> Does my formula calculate Ah or Ah/m2. How to contrast with what they've done

    -> THE WAY WE ARE DOING IS RIGHT... 
            HAD MISTAKES IN POROSITY PARAMETER, threw off capacity evaluation and electrode current density (j)

3) Min concentration on my end (negative) is limiting variable in capacity calcs.
