1) They are accounting for separator... etc

2) Current/m2 differences.
    -> Q (1/A) = di/dt (1/A) is weighted in capacity calculation?
    -> nominal capacity == current function (because Crate=1 assumed)
    -> Does my formula calculate Ah or Ah/m2. How to contrast with what they've done

3) Min concentration on my end (negative) is limiting variable in capacity calcs.
